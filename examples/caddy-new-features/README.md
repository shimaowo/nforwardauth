This is a very simple example of different usage of nforwardauth enabled by this fork:
- Docker is not used
- nforwardauth is hosted at a relative endpoint `http://localhost/auth/` instead of a subdomain
- The site files are hosted at `/home/you/nforwardauth/` instead of `/`
- A `.env` file is used to specify environment variables

All of these are optional.
